To further elucidate the role of this variant octamer motif in the regulation of germline transcription from the unrearranged kappa locus we have quantitated the relative binding affinity of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the variant octamer motif and determined the functional role of this octamer motif in transcriptional activation.\n",
