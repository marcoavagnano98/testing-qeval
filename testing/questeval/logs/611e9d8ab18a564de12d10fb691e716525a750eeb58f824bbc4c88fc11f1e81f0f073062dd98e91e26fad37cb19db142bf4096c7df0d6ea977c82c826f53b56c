These results suggest that coordination of NF-kappaB and STAT6 may be required for induction of germline transcription by IL-4 and that CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation may be important in regulating both enhancement of germline transcription and class switching to IFN-gamma-responsive genes.\n",
