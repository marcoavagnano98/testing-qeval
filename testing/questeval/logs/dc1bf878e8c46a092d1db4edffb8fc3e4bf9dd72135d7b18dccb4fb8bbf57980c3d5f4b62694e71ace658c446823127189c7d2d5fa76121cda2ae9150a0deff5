Thus it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel/NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses.\n",
