  "text": "These results demonstrate that CD40-mediated cell signaling is mediated via a pathway that includes NIK IKKalpha and IKKbeta. CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival growth differentiation and isotype switching of B lymphocytes. It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit IL-4 and IL-13-inducible gene expression.\n",
