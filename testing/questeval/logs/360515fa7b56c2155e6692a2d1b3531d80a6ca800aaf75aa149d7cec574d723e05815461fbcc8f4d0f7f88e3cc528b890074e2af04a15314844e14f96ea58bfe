Detection of myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88)-TLR2 complex confirmed interaction between the two for triggering the downstream signaling which ultimately led to TLR2-dependent nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. PIL-induced expression of MHC class II (I-Ab) CD40 and CD80 showed maturation of DC whereas up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CCR7 implicated the capacity of splenic DC to migrate.\n",
