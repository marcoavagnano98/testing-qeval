This transcription factor is activated via the selective phosphorylation ubiquination and degradation of its inhibitor protein I-kB thereby allowing translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus where it upregulates the transcription of a variety of adhesion molecules (e.g. ICAM-1 VCAM-1) cytokines (TNF IL-1 IL-6) and enzymes (iNOS).\n",
