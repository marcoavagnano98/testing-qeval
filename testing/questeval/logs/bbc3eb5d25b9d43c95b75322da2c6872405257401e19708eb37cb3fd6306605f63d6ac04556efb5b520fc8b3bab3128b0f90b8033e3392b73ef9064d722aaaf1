The effects of the two cytokines were distinguishable functionally since pretreatment with TNF-alpha attenuated the cytokine cooperativity while pretreatment with IL-10 potentiated their cooperativity suggesting that IL-10 and TNF-alpha play different roles in the activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1.\n",
