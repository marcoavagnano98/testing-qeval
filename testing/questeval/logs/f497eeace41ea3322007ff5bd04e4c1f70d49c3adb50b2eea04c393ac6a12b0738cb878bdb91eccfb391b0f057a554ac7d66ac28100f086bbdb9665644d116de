  "text": "As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to pancreatic beta cells we induced glycation in HIT-T15 cells using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity D-ribose and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription. The effects of D-ribose seemed almost irreversible but could be prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM N-acetylcysteine thus suggesting that glycation and reactive oxygen species generated through the glycation reaction serve as mediators of the phenomena.\n",
