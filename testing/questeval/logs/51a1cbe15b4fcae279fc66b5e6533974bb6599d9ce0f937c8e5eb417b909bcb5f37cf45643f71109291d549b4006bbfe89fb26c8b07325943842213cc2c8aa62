  "text": "When monocytes were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta protein production but the phorbol myristate-induced production was increased 3-10 fold. The inhibition correlated with a decrease in steady state levels of STAT proteins and not with the activation of the cytokine secretion of STAT proteins.\n",
