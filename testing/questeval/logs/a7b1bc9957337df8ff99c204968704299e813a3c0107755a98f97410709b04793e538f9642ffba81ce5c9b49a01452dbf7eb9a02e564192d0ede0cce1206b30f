  "text": "We find that the factor that binds to the E3 enhancer motif CATGTGGC is a ubiquitous transcription factor. However despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene the factor is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells: In previous experiments by others the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor designated NF-muE3 was detected in B cells but not in non-B cells.\\nFrom this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes: (a) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B that are not expressed in most other cell types: (b) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells; (c) ubiquitously active factors exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif.\n",
