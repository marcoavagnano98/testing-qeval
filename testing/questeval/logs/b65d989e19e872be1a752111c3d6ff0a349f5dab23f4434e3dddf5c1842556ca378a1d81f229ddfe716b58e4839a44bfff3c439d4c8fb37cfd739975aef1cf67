We now show that arsenite increased steady state levels of VEGF mRNA and activated transcription from a VEGF promoter construct. Finally we show that repression of VEGF by an ATF4-dependent mechanism is sufficient to block the activity of the Ras-related protein complex and to induce cell death.\n",
