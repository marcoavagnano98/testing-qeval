  "text": "Overexpression of SIT in Jurkat cells downmodulates T cell receptor- and phytohemagglutinin-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) by interfering with signaling processes that are probably located upstream of activation of phospholipase C. This stress is exerted specifically on the transcription factor NF-kappa B which is known to be important in regulating the expression of genes regulated by these transcription factors.\n",
