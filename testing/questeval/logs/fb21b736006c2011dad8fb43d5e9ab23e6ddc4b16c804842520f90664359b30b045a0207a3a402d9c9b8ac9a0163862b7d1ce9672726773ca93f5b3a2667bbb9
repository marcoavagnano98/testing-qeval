IL-4 promoter activity is rapidly induced by signals from the T cell antigen receptor that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 but not by its structural analog rapamycin. In support of this model we report that the human IL-4 promoter exists in multiple allelic forms that exhibit distinct transcriptional activities in IL-4-positive T cells.\n",
