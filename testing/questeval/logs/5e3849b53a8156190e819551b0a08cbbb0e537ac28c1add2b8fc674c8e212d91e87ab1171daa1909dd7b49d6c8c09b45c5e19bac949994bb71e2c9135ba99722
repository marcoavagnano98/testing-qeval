  "text": "As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to pancreatic beta cells we induced glycation in HIT-T15 cells using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity D-ribose and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription. The results indicated that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control beta-actin gene promoter; approximately 50 and 80% of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose respectively.\n",
