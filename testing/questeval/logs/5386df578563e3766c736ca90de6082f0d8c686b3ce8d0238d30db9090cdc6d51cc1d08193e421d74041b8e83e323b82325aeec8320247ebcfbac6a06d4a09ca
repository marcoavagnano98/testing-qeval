Expression of a specific inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in cells of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to a rapid phosphorylation of a shared group of intracellular signaling proteins including Vav Cbl p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn.\n",
