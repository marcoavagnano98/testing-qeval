PU.1 seems to be required for early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages but its expression in mature cells is preferentially observed in cells of the B-cell-and monocyte/macrophage-differentiation lineage. A gel retardation experiment with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides showed that both PU.1 and PU.1 bound to the PU.1 binding site in the PU.1 promoter.\n",
