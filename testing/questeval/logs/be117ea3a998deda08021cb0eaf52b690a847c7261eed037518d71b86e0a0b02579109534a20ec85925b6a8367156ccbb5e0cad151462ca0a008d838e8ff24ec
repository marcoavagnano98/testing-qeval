We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of GATA-1 is strongly repressed by the estrogen receptor (ER) in a ligand-dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. \u2047 nER-mediated repression of GATA-1 activity occurs on an artificial promoter containing a single GATA-binding site as well as in the context of an intact promoter which is normally regulated by GATA-1.\n",
