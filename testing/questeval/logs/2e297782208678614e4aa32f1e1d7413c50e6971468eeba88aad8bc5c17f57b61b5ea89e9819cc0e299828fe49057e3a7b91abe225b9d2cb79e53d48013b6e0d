MyD88 is an adaptor protein that binds to various regions of the interleukin-1 receptor alpha chain (IL-1R alpha) and IL-1R beta promoters. It is associated with various parts of the viral genome and is thought to mediate important transcription factors including NF-kappaB and cytokine receptors.\n",
