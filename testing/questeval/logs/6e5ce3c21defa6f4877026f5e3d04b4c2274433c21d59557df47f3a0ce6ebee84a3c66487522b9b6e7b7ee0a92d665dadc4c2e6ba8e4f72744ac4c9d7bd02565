The effects of the two mAbs were distinguishable functionally since pretreatment with TNF-alpha attenuated the cytokine cooperativity while pretreatment with IL-10 potentiated their cooperativity suggesting that IL-10 and TNF-alpha play different roles in the activation of the NF-kappa B complex.\n",
