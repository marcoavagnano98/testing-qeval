These findings provide the first direct evidence that both CsA-sensitive transcription factors NFATp and NFATc are expressed in human NK cells and that their activation and/or expression can be regulated in primary cells by a single stimulus that in the case of CD16 in NK cells results in early activation of NFATp and subsequently induced expression of NFATc mRNA.\n",
