Activation of NF-kappa B is dependent upon the phosphorylation and degradation of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta which raises the intracellular calcium concentration. Together these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I Tax expression induces the transcription and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B/Rel proteins thus regulating IL-2 gene expression and thereby stimulating I kappa B alpha gene expression.\n",
