  "text": "Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR it was first found that culture protein filtrates (CFP) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM. Therefore we investigated the relationship between the activation of the HIV-1 LTR and changes in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activation of the HIV-1 LTR.\n",
