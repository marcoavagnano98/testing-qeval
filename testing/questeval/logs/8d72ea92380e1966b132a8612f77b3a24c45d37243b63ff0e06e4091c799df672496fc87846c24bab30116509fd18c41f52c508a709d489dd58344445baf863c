  "text": "During myelopoiesis which includes the development of granulocytic and monocytic lineages transcription factors from several families are active including AML1/CBF beta C/EBP Ets c-Myb HOX and MZF-1. Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in myeloid cells; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of myeloid-specific genes. Myeloid progenitors are distinct from those responding to the granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor.\n",
