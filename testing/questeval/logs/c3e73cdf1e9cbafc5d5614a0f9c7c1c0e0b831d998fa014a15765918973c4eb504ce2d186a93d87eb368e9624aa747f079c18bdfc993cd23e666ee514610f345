However the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global TCR/CD3-signaling defect because CD3 cross-linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular-free calcium ions as well as NFATp dephosphorylation translocation to the nucleus and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells.\n",
